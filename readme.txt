I have created all rest api's in nodejs and fetched through php
Here is the list of following API's

1)/posts - to fetch all the post [get request]
2)/register - to register the new user
3)/post/:id -to display post detail from given id
4)/login -to login the user
5)/user/post/:id -to display user posts
6)/user/post/delete - to delete the user post
7)/user/post/add - to add the user post

Also,I have exported Mysql database

Due to time constraint I was unable to perform the following tasks:

1)Front validtion with javascript
2)proper backend validation in nodejs using try and catch block
3)File handling ie. I am using the static image for every blog
4)unable to deploy project in heroku
